# **0. INTRO. OF THIS WEBSITE**
---

**1. Why write mainly in English?**
<br> 
Let’s keep it real—I’m a little lazy when it comes to switching input methods! But honestly, there’s a more practical reason too: when I want to jot down thoughts (especially tech-related ones), so many keywords or terms only feel natural in English. Writing in English lets me skip the hassle of translating back and forth, so I can just focus on getting my ideas down easily.  
<br> 

**2. What’s your take on Operations Research (OR)?**  
<br> 
To me, OR is basically a super cool subfield of applied math—one that lets me blend two things I love: math and engineering. I’ve always thought math shouldn’t just live in textbooks; it should *do* something in real life. And that’s exactly what OR is for! It takes those tricky optimization problems we face daily and turns them into solutions that actually work. It’s like the perfect sweet spot for my interests.  
<br> 

**3. What do you think about the “Open World” (of information)?**
<br> 
I’m totally against information walls—anywhere in the world. Ideas, knowledge, and stories are meant to flow freely, right? When there are barriers keeping people from accessing or sharing info, we all miss out. I’d much rather live in a space where curiosity doesn’t hit a wall.

If someone can take responsibility for what they say and do, and they don’t hurt others, then I believe no one else has the right to limit their expression or silence them.

One of the main reasons I created this website was to encompass all the things I wish to share with you. I prefer not to rely on other companies; I trust only my own.


<br> 

**4. Hey friend, tell us more about your work or life mindset!**  
<br> 
For work: My days are mostly about turning messy, complex optimization problems into solutions that people can actually use. But I’m just as excited to step out of that “algorithm bubble” for real, laid-back chats. If you’re in Shenzhen (even just passing through!), I’d love to grab a coffee—no stuffy agendas, just rambling about tech, life, or whatever’s on your mind.  

When I’m not buried in data or tweaking models? You’ll find me geeking out over one of these:  
- Obsessing over the latest tech gadgets (I’ve definitely lost hours picking apart a new device’s design or how it works);  
- Getting lost in fictional worlds—climbing rooftops in *Assassin’s Creed*, teaming up for a *League of Legends* match, or rewatching classics like *Fast and Furious* (for the 100th time) or *The Godfather* (don’t judge how many times I’ve replayed those scenes);  
- Chasing real-life adventures: I love traveling to spots that aren’t on every tourist list, snapping photos to capture little moments, or messing around with vlogging (I’m still learning, but it’s so much fun).  

This blog’s where I’ll share bits of all that—tech takeaways from projects, travel stories, random hobby thoughts, and everything in between. Thanks for stopping by, and if you ever want to chat or connect, just holler!
