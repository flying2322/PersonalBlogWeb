- Hello, I’m **Dominic Li** 👋
- So glad our paths crossed here—thanks for pausing to say hi!

- I’m an Operations Research Algorithm Engineer based in the dynamic city of Shenzhen, China. For me, work is all about turning complex optimization problems into actionable solutions, but I’m just as eager to step out of the “algorithm zone” for real, casual chats. If you’re in town (or even just passing through), I’d love to grab a coffee, swap thoughts on tech, life, or anything in between—no formal agendas, just good conversation.

- When I’m not deep in data or model tuning, you’ll probably find me immersed in one of these:

  - Geeking out over the latest tech products (I can spend hours dissecting a new gadget’s design or functionality);
  Diving into immersive worlds—whether it’s climbing rooftops in Assassin’s Creed, teaming up for a match in League of Legends, or revisiting classics like the Fast and Furious franchise or The Godfather series (yes, I’ve rewatched the latter more times than I’d admit publicly);
  - Chasing moments outside the screen: I love traveling to off-the-beaten-path spots, capturing stories with my camera through photography, and turning those adventures into short snippets via vlogging (still learning, but having a blast with it!).

  - This blog is where I’ll share bits of my journey—from tech insights and project takeaways to travel diaries and hobby musings. Thanks again for stopping by, and feel free to reach out if you want to connect!
